# Lightweight Browser-Only OpenBSD Roadmap

## Introduction
This roadmap guides the development of a specialized OpenBSD variant focused solely on running a web browser. The goal is to strip away any unnecessary components, thus creating a lightweight, secure, and efficient system for browser-based operations.

## Phase 1: Planning & Setup

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Set up an OpenBSD development environment either natively or within a virtual machine.
   - Clone the OpenBSD source repository to a local environment for modification.

2. **Backup & Version Control**:
   - Initialize a new Git repository to track changes and modifications.
   - Commit the original OpenBSD source as the initial commit for reference.

## Phase 2: Kernel Customization

3. **Kernel Configuration**:
   - Start with the GENERIC kernel configuration.
   - Comment out unnecessary drivers, especially those relevant to physical hardware since the OS will run on VMs.
   - Remove support for unnecessary filesystems.
   - Optimize networking components for browser use.

4. **Compile & Test**:
   - Compile the modified kernel and test within a VM.
   - Ensure basic functionality and boot processes work as expected.

## Phase 3: Userland Pruning

5. **Identify & Remove Redundant Utilities**:
   - List all binaries in `/usr/bin/` and `/usr/sbin/`.
   - Identify and remove utilities not required for browser functionality.
   
6. **Libraries & Dependencies**:
   - Identify libraries that are no longer needed due to the removal of certain utilities and services.
   - Remove unneeded libraries but ensure that essential libraries for the browser and system stability remain intact.

## Phase 4: Filesystem Cleanup

7. **Remove Unnecessary Files & Directories**:
   - Delete documentation, man pages, and other files related to removed utilities.
   - Clean up any configuration files and directories that are no longer relevant.

8. **Reorganize Filesystem**:
   - Ensure all required files for the browser are located in the appropriate directories.
   - Set up any required permissions and security contexts for the remaining files.

## Phase 5: Browser Integration

9. **Browser Selection & Compilation**:
   - Choose a lightweight browser suitable for the OS.
   - Compile the browser from source and integrate it into the OS.
   
10. **Browser Optimization**:
   - Set up the browser to start on boot.
   - Ensure all browser dependencies are met and functioning correctly.
   - Optimize browser settings for performance and security.

## Phase 6: Security Enhancements

11. **Firewall & Networking**:
   - Set up the OpenBSD firewall (pf) with strict rules to only allow necessary traffic.
   - Harden networking components against potential threats.

12. **Service Hardening**:
   - Disable all unnecessary services and daemons.
   - Ensure only the browser and essential services run on startup.

13. **User Privileges**:
   - Set up a non-root user to run the browser.
   - Ensure minimal privileges for all processes.

## Phase 7: Testing & Deployment

14. **Alpha Testing**:
   - Test the OS internally for functionality, performance, and security.
   - Identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise.

15. **Beta Testing**:
   - Release the OS to a select group of users for external testing.
   - Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

16. **Final Release & Deployment**:
   - Once satisfied with the OS's stability and performance, prepare it for final release.
   - Document the installation process, features, and any known issues.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to creating a lightweight and secure OpenBSD variant focused on browser use. Regularly review and adjust the roadmap based on the challenges and requirements encountered during the development process.
