# Lightweight & Secure OS for Bots

## Introduction
This project is an initiative to create a minimalistic but secure operating system tailored for bot operations. By leveraging the foundational strengths of OpenBSD and trimming down unnecessary components, we aim to provide an efficient and safe environment for bots to function.

## Motivation
In the modern digital landscape, bots play a pivotal role in automating various tasks. However, they often operate in environments bloated with unnecessary services and components, leading to inefficiencies and potential vulnerabilities. This project addresses these concerns by:
- **Reducing Overhead**: By focusing only on essential components, our OS ensures bots can function at optimal efficiency.
- **Enhancing Security**: Using OpenBSD as a base, known for its robust security features, we ensure our bots operate in a safe environment, free from potential threats.

## Why OpenBSD?
OpenBSD offers a strong foundation with its emphasis on code correctness and security. By building upon this foundation, we ensure our OS inherits these robust characteristics while being tailored for bot operations.

## Future Plans
We aim to continually refine this OS, ensuring it remains up-to-date with the latest security standards and is optimized for evolving bot functionalities.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute to this project. Your insights and expertise can help make this OS the go-to choice for bot operations worldwide!
